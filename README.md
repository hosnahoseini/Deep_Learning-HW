# Deep Learning Homework
This repository contains my completed homework assignments for the Deep Learning course offered by the Sharif University.

## HW1
- Perform dimensionality reduction and train an autoencoder on the Fashion-MNIST dataset using PyTorch, including PCA and t-SNE for visualization.

## HW2
- Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch and train it to classify the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
- Adapt and fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet model for classifying the CIFAR dataset, demonstrating transfer learning on more complex image data.

## HW4
- Build and train a masked language model using PyTorch (similar to BERT) and Hugging Faceâ€™s library (RoBERTa model) on the Persian "Mianeh" dataset.
- Fine-tune previous models for POS-tagging tasks.
- Explore the Deepwalk algorithm for graph-based learning, applying it to the MovieLens dataset to analyze movie similarities and ratings.

## HW5
- Implement an autoregressive image model based on PixelCNN and analyze its strengths and weaknesses.
- Train a GAN and a Conditional GAN (cGAN) for generating simple images, learning core concepts of GANs using PyTorch.
- Build and train a self-supervised contrastive model for image data, leveraging the Fashion-MNIST dataset to explore the learned latent space.

## HW6
- Implement PPO and TRPO algorithms for the Lunar Lander environment and compare their results.
- Implement Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to address challenges in the Lunar Lander environment.
